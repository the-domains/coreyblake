[Path to Purpose][0]

[Path to Purpose][0] is RTC's online program to help you write the book you were born to write. We've been guiding leaders (running multi-million dollar and multi-billion dollar companies) down this path for 10 years, and we are now making our process available to everyone. [Path to Purpose][0] is a monthly subscription service where members have access to a dozen modules full of articles, videos, assignments and exercises, as well as private Q&A sessions, group coaching calls, live seminars  and webinars, interviews with CEOs and thoughts leaders, and a private online community for support. The program offers more than 80 hours of innovative content to guide participants through the book writing process and support members in sharing their stories, creating thought leadership platforms, and monetizing their tribes. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4e285d94d0b16bc3f8bbcba1acec64a049f270bc.jpg)
