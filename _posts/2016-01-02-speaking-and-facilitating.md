As a speaker, my purpose is to hold loving space for others where transformation is ignited. That requires that I demonstrate vulnerability from the stage and then invite my audiences into a space of connecting with themselves and with one another. It is my job to activate that magic that lives within each of us and to create the opportunity for participants to be seen by one another beyond their job title or latest success or failure.

You might find me opening a conference where the producers want their audience to connect deeply and quickly so they can risk more while they are together.

You might find me leading a board of directors in helping them to uncover their story.

You might find me working with a community of CEOs to help them articulate their purpose or leading a group of marketers to guide them to the power of their authenticity. 

And you might find me leading a session with students--helping them to find their compass before they enter the world.

For a speaking kit and more information on how I could impact your group or community, please contact Keli McNeil at [Keli@roundtablecompanies.com][0].
