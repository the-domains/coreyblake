The ORP Library

[Oconomowoc Residential Properties][0] (ORP)--a company serving
the needs of children with severe disabilities--came to me in 2012 to help
share their 40 years of wisdom in the industry and to activate the word of
mouth and social media of parents they support. Since then, RTC's team has
produced and packaged [19 products for them][1]: 10 books, 3 comic
books, 2 children's books, an activity book, a major textbook and workbook
(used by universities), and a curriculum for the company. As a result, ORP has
handed out over 30,000 books to parents, educators, and healthcare
professionals. They have also been pushed to open new facilities to serve the
influx of new clients since our work started together. Our latest project is
building an [online community][2], which was launched in December of 2014 and currently serves an audience of more than 9,000 parents, educators, and health care workers.
