The Vulnerability Wall

RTC was a proud sponsor of the Conscious Capitalism Summit
in Chicago in April 2015 and then again at the CEO summit in October. I was
honored to talk about "LOVE" and then to present my
workshop/keynote The Vulnerability Quotient on the main stage three times
between those two events. RTC also created [Vulnerability Walls][0] at both events
led by our creative director Sunny DiMartino. Attendees shared personal vulnerabilities by writing them down and placing them anonymously in a
box. Our artists depicted these vulnerabilities beautifully on the walls,
initiating connection and an overall feeling that, first and foremost we are
human beings doing our best in the world.

The Vulnerability Wall will next appear at the Hope Global
Forums Annual Summit in Atlanta in January, 2016 to an audience of 3,000, and
then again in April at the Conscious Capital event in Chicago.
