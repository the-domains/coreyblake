I work almost exclusively with CEOs and Thought Leaders who have achieved success and have realized that **legacy** is different.  

They are struggling with one of these questions:__

* _"Who do I want to be remembered as?"_
* _"Am I meant for more than this?"_
* _"Is it arrogant to believe I could matter this much?"_
* _"How do I remain true to myself without hurting others?"_
* _"Who do I need beside me to explore these questions?"_

Maybe you want to challenge the way an industry thinks and behaves. Maybe you're ready to start a new purpose driven business or inspire people from the stage. Maybe you're ready to take what you've learned and share it outside the safe bubble of your industry. Or maybe you want to capture your story for your children's children and future generations, or to save others from the pain you've endured.

While other speakers, authors, consultants, and companies focus on the _WHY_ and the _HOW _of this kind of work, my focus is on the _**WHO**_. 

**Who are you to believe that you are here to do anything less than change the world?**

**What intersections have prepared you for this awesome destiny?**

**What darkness from your life can be turned into your greatest gift?**

**Who have you been? Who are you know? And Who is emerging?**

These are huge questions. And most of us do not have the skills to express our answers in ways that fully invite others into what we think, feel, and stand for. 

And that's the problem I solve. I help align the beauty of people's truth with their language so they can be powerfully seen.
