## You were born to change the world. 

I was born to believe in you.

I help organizations and thought leaders to step into their purpose and actualize what they were meant to do in this world. But I'm not a coach or a consultant. I'm an actor. I'm a storyteller. I'm a speaker and Facilitator. And I'm the founder and CEO of Round Table Companies (RTC) where I employ a growing staff of forty writers, editors, artists, designers, and educators who surround our clients with talent and love as they help them re-author who they are in the world.

The people we challenge represent some of the most beautiful, successful, and humble spirits changing the world today. From founders and CEOs to spiritual healers, from world renowned coaches and speakers to social impact investors, we are blessed to serve a community of people dedicated to impacting lives.

If you know you should be impacting more lives... If you're ready to expand beyond your current capacity for joy... If you're ready for your greatest adventure yet... we should talk.
